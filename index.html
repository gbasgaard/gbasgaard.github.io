        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>
          I enjoy developing CRUD apps with Node.js/Express and Ruby on Rails. Agile development is the name of the game. Also, React is also something that tickles my fancy.

      <div class="column col-md-6">
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>
          Like many web developers, my first introduction into this crazy world was through HTML and CSS. I started off designing basic sites that looked like they came straight out of the '90s, but over time I've developed more of an affinity for mobile-first responsive design. I enjoy hand-coding certain things as well as working with frameworks such as Bootstrap, Foundation and Materialize.

        <h3>Learning</h3>
        <p>
          I'm always trying to further advance my skills as a developer in all aspects. I got my start on sites like codecademy, codeschool and teamtreehouse, which I still use to brush up on certain things. The best way to learn though is by doing, so I make sure to work on projects of my own that I'm passionate about. I believe making continuous commits to GitHub allows me to excel as a web developer.

      <div class="column col-md-6">
        <h3>Free Time</h3>
        <p>
          When I'm not behind the screen you can find me with my nose in a book, traveling, enjoying the outdoors, sharing in the groove at a Phish show, sampling craft beer, discoverying new tunes, or taking photos among other things.
